# LiveBusTracker - Work in Progress
This web app is powered by Auckland Transport API and OpenLayers API which is based on OpenStreetMaps.

## Requirements

## Setting Up

## Features
* This web app allows the user to search for a bus number which will display the location of every active bus for that number. The user can set it so that the locations update every 30 seconds without having to reload the page or search again.
* Clicking on the bus will show its route name along with occupancy status and next stop information. The map will also plot the location of the next stop for that specific bus.
* The web app can grab the user's location (with their permission) and plot it on the map. It will show all bus stops in a 1km radius (W.I.P.).
